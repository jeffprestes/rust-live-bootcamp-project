# Skill Instructions

The `gitcommit` skill is designed to help you generate concise and informative commit messages based on the changes made in your code. To use this skill effectively, follow these instructions:

1. **Provide Context**: Analyze the changes made in the code and provide a brief summary of what was changed. This can include the files modified, the purpose of the changes, and any relevant details that can help in understanding the context of the commit.

2. **Generate Commit Message**: Based on the provided context, generate a commit message that is clear, concise, and informative. The commit message should ideally follow the conventional commit format, which includes a type (e.g., feat, fix, docs), a scope (optional), and a brief description of the changes. It cannot have any mention to the fact that it was generated by an AI.

3. **Review and Edit**: After generating the commit message, review it for accuracy and clarity. Make any necessary edits to ensure that the message accurately reflects the changes made in the code and is easy to understand for other developers who may read it in the future.

4. **Use the Commit Message**: Once you are satisfied with the generated commit message, use it when committing your changes to the version control system (e.g., Git). This will help maintain a clear and organized commit history, making it easier for you and your team to track changes and understand the evolution of the codebase.

5. **Commit the changes**: After using the generated commit message, proceed to commit your changes to the repository. This will ensure that your commit history remains consistent and informative for future reference.
No need to confirm the commit message with the user, just use it directly when committing the changes. The user can always edit the commit message later if they wish to make any adjustments.

6. **Push the changes**: After committing your changes, remember to push them to the remote repository so that they are available to other team members and can be integrated into the main codebase.
